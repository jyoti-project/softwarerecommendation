We provide software by category. This system suggests necessary software based on your needs in the Software System, and you may download
the software from the software category. Assist users with finding applications, or offer a platform for other software, such as Firefox, Chrome, and
Microsoft Office. System software is software that serves as a foundation for other applications. Operating systems such as MacOS, GNU/Linux,
Android, and Microsoft Windows are examples of system software, as are computational scientific software, gaming engines, industrial automation,
and software-as-a-service applications. In most cases, computer users wrote their own software to meet their individual hardware and requirements.
